"""
This file is here to define a common ground for researcher and patient interaction

All the attributes need to be CAPITAL and must not contain underscore, 
otherwise the implementation will not work.

complexity: to distinguish 2^n attributes, one needs 2n bits. 
the consequence is if the attribute count > 6 (n>=4) its worth to create a binary 
representation (maybe this is not all there is to it, it might be, that having shorter 
policies is better than having less attributes. TODO:timeit)
